Write a web application for managing books in a personal library. The application should maintain various information about a book in the database (i.e. author, title, pages, genre etc.). The application should implement: book browsing (use AJAX for retrieving books from a specific category/genre), adding, removing, updating a book, lending books. Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. category/genre), should be displayed (do this in javascript).
